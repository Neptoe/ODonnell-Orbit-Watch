# ODonnell-Orbit-Watch 
Orbit is a smartwatch designed specifically to help children and adults with ADHD manage their time and tasks effectively. The watch works through a series of customizable, parent-programmed alerts and reminders that help guide users through their daily routines. This software would be accessible via a companion mobile app, where users or caregivers can set up schedules, assign tasks, and configure reminders in a way that best suits their needs. 
Intended functions:\n
Customizable Alerts & Reminders – Users can schedule task reminders, such as homework time, brushing teeth, or getting ready for school, through a mobile app. 
  Vibrational & Visual Cues – Instead of relying on sound-based notifications (which can be distracting in class or work), the watch uses vibrations and visual cues to notify the user. 
  Routine Management – Create detailed schedules, including morning and evening routines, with specific timed blocks for each task (e.g., Wake Up, Eat, Brush Teeth, Get   Dressed, etc.). 
  Persistent Reminders – Tasks remain on the watch until marked complete, helping users stay accountable. 
  Countdown Warnings – Users receive transition warnings at intervals (e.g., 15, 10, 5, and 1 minute) before the next scheduled task begins. 
  Task Timers – Includes general timers, Pomodoro-style timers, and programmable task timers (e.g., Clean Room – 15 minutes, Daily Reading – 30 minutes). 
  Positive Reinforcement System – Tracks behaviors such as completing tasks and meeting weekly goals, rewarding users with encouragement or parent-set rewards. 
  AI Task Breakdown – AI helps break down complex tasks into simple, timed steps, making large tasks more manageable. 
  Emergency Notifications – Quick-call or message alerts to caregivers in case the user needs assistance.
