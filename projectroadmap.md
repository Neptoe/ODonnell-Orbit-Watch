Intelligent Alarm Clock with ToDo list
#Tanya notes: I ran this semi-successfully once - One of the sound functions didn't work. The later times I ran it, it is pretty buggy and not running. I have downloaded several pips and working through some bypasses/workarounds for files that are not there. But no luck. Is anyone else having better luck?
