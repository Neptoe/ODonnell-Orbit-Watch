Intelligent Alarm Clock with ToDo list

#Tanya notes: I ran this semi-successfully once - One of the sound functions didn't work. The later times I ran it, it is pretty buggy and not running. I have downloaded several pips and working through some bypasses/workarounds for files that are not there. But no luck. Is anyone else having better luck?

#Tanya notes - this is in Python 2 and required modifications to run in Python 3. Does not connect to the youtube videos as the code states. When you set the alarm, it notes the time every one minute in the terminal. 

#Will update from laptop
#Tanya notes - This one works! And it comes with a jaunty little ditty.

#Tanya - runs okay. If you click on Start a second time instead of Reset, the timer starts flipping between work and break without stopping. Resetting the timer at this point does not help. You have to close out of it and start it all over again.
