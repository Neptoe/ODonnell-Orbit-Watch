Intelligent Alarm Clock with ToDo list

#Tanya notes: I ran this semi-successfully once - One of the sound functions didn't work. The later times I ran it, it is pretty buggy and not running. I have downloaded several pips and working through some bypasses/workarounds for files that are not there. But no luck. Is anyone else having better luck?

#Tanya notes - this is in Python 2 and required modifications to run in Python 3. Does not connect to the youtube videos as the code states. When you set the alarm, it notes the time every one minute in the terminal. 

#Will update from laptop
#Tanya notes - This one works! And it comes with a jaunty little ditty.

#Elizabeth notes - Parts of the code are functional, but its trajectory doesn’t quite align with the Orbit watch’s path. It’s buggy. It overall does not  deliver on audio notifications and I couldn’t get the font customization to work either.  It does however count down briefly before it freezes.

#Kayla Notes: Start Reminder is an audio message " Here are your tasks for the Day". A good start for a Daily Task Function. Currently unable to add tasks within the program, but we might need to add a "get user input" modification or an append option.

No Snooze but will repeat alarm if not completed on the watch

#Elizabeth - For the sake of our project, it seems to have too many windows pop up, creating to much visual clutter for our end user. However, it shouldn’t be discarded as it could help with the app development. One thing I really liked was the ability to edit a list while creating it, and I also appreciated the flexibility of being able to add multiple lists.

[ ]Prebuilt Pomodoro Timer

#Tanya - runs okay. If you click on Start a second time instead of Reset, the timer starts flipping between work and break without stopping. Resetting the timer at this point does not help. You have to close out of it and start it all over again.
